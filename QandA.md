### Questions and Answers for Graduate Students

This Q&A is divided into four main categories: Research, Advising, Funding, and Lab Culture. They are tailored to PhD students but can be relevant to Master's students as well.

### Research

**What kind of progress do you expect from me?**

Once you have (essentially) finished courses in your second year, you should be able to spend full cycles on research. _In your first year_, I expect that you will focus on taking classes, building your ability to read and present academic papers, and start to get your feet wet with research by working on an existing (or new!) research project in the lab. The first year will look different for different people, but the bottom line is that I expect that, by the end of your first year, you should have mastered most of the essential skills you need to engage with research and passed your written qualifying exam. A good goal for all first year students is to think about submitting a conference paper in the fall of second year.

_In subsequent years,_ I expect that you focus almost all work-related effort on research and at any given time maintain a mix of projects you are "leading" and those you are "helping out with." Every student's journey will be different, though, so if you are not sure how things are going or how to plan your schedule, let's talk.

**How many papers do you expect from your students? What is the typical lifecycle of a project/paper?**

1-2 a year is a decent number. You should be able to hit that with absolutely no problem by your third year. More is better, if they are high quality. It is worse if they are getting in the way of you being able to think deeply about more significant research problems. By your third year, you should be able to go from "rough idea" to "submitted conference paper" in roughly 6-9 months. Obviously, this is something that you get more comfortable with over time and as you get more experienced. So, for example, I expect most people's first paper to be based on work they start by the end of the first semester, and not get submitted until the end of the following summer. By your fifth year, you should probably be able to work on 3-4 projects every year, or more.

**What kind of projects do you see me working on?**

I want them to be mostly coming from you, and adapted based on our discussions. But you will be the driver. I hope that your projects will teach me new things!

**When working on new ideas, how do you know when it looks like a dead end, and how do you determine that?**

I think the secret is to just have multiple projects going on at any one time. Your first project is usually going to be something that I help suggest… and therefore it'll almost certainly be "low risk" from a technical perspective. In future, you should have multiple of "your own" things going on at once so that you can bounce between them as you feel one of them hitting a snag, then come back when you want to.

**How do you stay motivated and disciplined?**

Keep a normal 8-5 schedule. Don't work too hard on the weekend (maybe just 4 hrs on a typical weekend once you have finished taking all your classes and are in "research-only" mode). Make sure you have multiple projects, with multiple different collaborators. That helps keep things exciting.

### Advising

**What do you do when students are struggling? How do you know when to step in and help more vs. letting the student figure it out?**

I air on the side of letting students figure things out themselves, with only minimal technical pointers from me. A PhD is not about being taught by an advisor, at least not in the sense of learning lots of technical details from him/her. It's about being *advised* to investigate interesting questions, and learning to find the resources and technical capabilities you need to figure them out. An advisor can help point, but is not the person who teaches those capabilities, at least not most of the time.

Put another way: if a student will always be struggling without their advisor's support, then the advisor has failed to train a self-reliant student who will be capable of success in the future. You are in charge of your own education, and I expect students to take charge!

**How do you approach the writing process with students?**

Communication is probably the most important part of science and engineering. I expect students to develop excellent communication skills, both in writing and in speaking. I will happily look at drafts and give feedback, but you need to be proactive in writing early, soliciting feedback, revising, and repeating the loop as much as needed until you have a manuscript you are proud of. Please consult the [lab writing guide](https://github.com/CLeARoboticsLab/resources/blob/main/CLeAR_lab_writing_guide.pdf) for more detaIls.

**For collaborative projects, what is the expected level of contribution from everyone for the collaboration to work?**

It varies from project to project, and should be organic in my opinion. People should contribute as much as they want to, and if no one wants to contribute enough to make the project work, then the project was always going to be doomed. If someone is not contributing meaningfully, then they should politely tell their collaborators that they are either uninterested or do not have bandwidth to be a good collaborator. On the other hand, there can be tremendous value to having a collaborator who only contributes periodically but whose input helps direct the project in useful directions. Contributions come in many forms.

**The lab seems to be growing larger pretty quickly. How do you support everyone?**

With difficulty and much grant writing. Also, I expect every student to TA at least two semesters during the PhD. This will vary depending upon funding needs, but TAing is a really important educational experience and provides a great way to practice technical communication. I found it essential as a graduate student.

**What do you see me doing during summer? Internships?**

Whatever you want, for the most part. There is a small chance I might prefer you to intern certain summers if I am short $$. The sooner we talk about things the better.

**Would you help students enter the job market?**

Definitely!

### Funding

**Do you anticipate funding to change during my time as a student?**

Yes, the source will definitely change. I will do my best to make sure it does not affect your research at all.

**Should I apply for fellowships?**

If you are eligible and have good grades, yes.

### Lab Culture

**The lab is still relatively new; what are your plans for the lab for the future?**

I want to build a vibrant lab where ~6-10 PhD students are intellectually curious and self-motivated to study questions they find exciting at the intersection of optimization, control, games, etc. I want to learn new things from my students, and I want everyone to enjoy working together.

**How much are we expected to work on papers alone vs. with other colleagues/students? How would we compartmentalize tasks?**

You should have something — a "story" — that is your own, primarily. This will be your thesis. On the other hand, that "story" can and should intersect with others' and you should collaborate to your heart's content. For example, my "story" was fast algorithms for N-player smooth dynamic games, with applications to human-robot interaction. I was the primary driver behind the algorithmic part for games, but literally every single paper had at least one other student coauthor, and in half/most I was not the first author. This was great. I would have quit the PhD if it had all been solo.
