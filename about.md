### About us
We are a group of scientists and engineers working at the intersection between robotics, control theory, machine learning, and game theory to design high performance, interactive autonomous systems. Our lab is based in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics](https://www.ae.utexas.edu) and is affiliated with [Texas Robotics](https://robotics.utexas.edu) and the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://oden.utexas.edu).

### Research
Some of our lab's core research interests are:

- posing interactive motion planning problems as multi-player, noncooperative dynamic games and designing efficient algorithms to solve them
- inferring properties of game-theoretic interactions, such as equilibrium type, player objectives, and constraints
- building a rapprochement between machine learning methods and classical techniques for robust, adaptive, and geometric control

### Lab members

Our group started in August 2021. Visit our [people page]({% link people.md %}) for profiles of lab members.

### Prospective students

If you are a prospective *graduate student*, please feel free to reach out to David by email to express your interest. In your note, please identify one recent publication from the lab that you find interesting, and explain the technical nugget you found most exciting. Please also mention your favorite math class and the most exciting topic you learned in that class.

If you are an *undergraduate student* who is interested in doing research in the lab, e.g. for a summer internship, please _first_ reach out to students or postdocs in the lab and try to identify a potential mentor. Once you have identified a potential mentor, please email David and cc that mentor.
